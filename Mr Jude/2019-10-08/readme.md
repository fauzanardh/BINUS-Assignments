## EX1
1. Calculate the total number of steps taken per day
2. Make a histogram of the total number of steps taken each day
3. Calculate and report the mean and median of the total number of steps taken per day

## EX2
1. Make a time series plot of the 5-minute interval (x-axis) and the average number of steps taken,
averaged across all days (y-axis)
2. Which 5-minute interval, on average across all the days in the dataset, contains the maximum number of
steps

## EX3
1. Calculate and report the total number of missing values in the dataset (i.e. the total number of rows with
NAs)
2. Devise a strategy for filling in all of the missing values in the dataset
3. Create a new dataset that is equal to the original dataset but with the missing data filled in.
4. Make a histogram of the total number of steps taken each day and Calculate and report the mean and
median total number of steps taken per day.

## EX4

whether a given date is a weekday or weekend day.
2. Make a plot containing a time series plot of the 5-minute interval (x-axis) and the average number of
steps taken, averaged across all weekdays or weekend days (y-axis).
